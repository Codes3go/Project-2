# Project-2 - Web Scraping 
These notebooks show the process of web scraping and data cleaning tables from five pages. The tables provided information relating to various metrics of each state, such as employment rates, minimum wage, migration rates, mean household income and GDP. These metrics where then merged into one data frame and analyzed to answer relavent research questions.

In this repository, there is a notebook detailing how each page (employment, GDP, household income, migration and minimum wage) was data scraped and cleaned. There is also a notebook called Research questions and graphs, which uses graphs to answer questions comparing the various states, and regions. 

The pages used for this project can be found here:
